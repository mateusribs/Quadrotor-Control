# Quadrotor Control
 An repository that implements a simple attitude and position control for an UAV. A cascade PID control is designed to control position and attiude. For trajectory planning, a trajectory generator based on Mellinger and Kumar (2011) research is proposed, in which they used the snap minimization to produce smooth curves.
